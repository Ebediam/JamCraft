  - Hello, friend! Welcome to Oren, our humble village.
  - We really need your help, as you can see there's not a lot going on now.
  - We should start to build some neat things!
  - I was going to build a welcome post, but I've made short of wood.
  - Please, bring me two branches and I'll finish it.

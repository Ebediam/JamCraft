  - You're not going to get that far just by collecting things from the ground.
  - You need to be able to craft your own tools and create more advanced items.
  - Bring me 4 sticks and 3 planks and I'll build you a crafting table.
  - In the forest there's a wolf, he might be able to help you gather the materials.

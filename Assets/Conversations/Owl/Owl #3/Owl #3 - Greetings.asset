  - Mmmm, I think we need a watch tower.
  - If we're going to build our village here, we need to be able to see who is approaching.
  - (also, I really like towers...)
  - 'Yeah, that seems like a great idea. '
  - 'Okay, I''m going to need 10 planks, 20 branches and a rope. '
  - I really recommend you getting an axe, there are not that many branches laying
    around!
  - You can craft one yourself or maybe you can find someone else's laying around.
  - To equip a tool, open your inventory and click on the tool.

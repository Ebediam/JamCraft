  - Oh, hello. Do you need something?
  - Planks and sticks? Well, I can give you some, I have plenty.
  - But first, I need you to bring me a red flower.
  - There are none in this forest and I don't want to venture outside.
  - Why do I want a flower, you ask?
  - They are pretty and I like them, that's why.
